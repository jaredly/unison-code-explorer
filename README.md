# About

An HTTP server for show information about a [Unison](http://unisonweb.org/) codebase, along with an Elm client for viewing it.

Inspired by [haskell-code-explorer](https://github.com/alexwl/haskell-code-explorer).

# Status

Heavily WIP-- basically the only thing working is the server generating a function call graph.
